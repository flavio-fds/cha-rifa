# Software architecture

The software architecture is define in the [workspace.dsl](workspace.dsl) file.
We used the [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/help/dsl) to describe its
building blocks and relationships.
Use the [Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite) to visualize the
diagrams.
Run the `make c4-lite-server` command to spin up a local server using Docker and
access http://localhost:8080 to interact with the diagrams in a browser.
